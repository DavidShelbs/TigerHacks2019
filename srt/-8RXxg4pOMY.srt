1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,940
- Oh, this is gonna be
the most popular Halloween costume.

2
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:05,503
- If this is what he does
to make money,

3
00:00:05,503 --> 00:00:07,020
I wanna be Kanye West.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,010

in the old days,

00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,815
they couldn't say the [bleep]
they wanted to say.

7
00:00:13,816 --> 00:00:17,240
They had to fake orgasms and [bleep].
- What is this?

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,099
- (Adele) "Hey, I wanna
[bleep], [bleep]!"

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,210
- What is this?!

10
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:22,000
- (Adele) We can tell [bleep] today,
"Hey, I wanna..."

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,090
- Kanye and Lil Pump.
- There we go, baby!

12
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,180
Ahh! (laughs)

what this costume is.

23
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:59,257

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,970
[bleep]."
- Okay. I've never seen that before.

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,660
- I love it. I'ma ho for this.
I love it.

48
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,480
- I love the song itself and the beat.
The lyrics, though... a little scandy.

49
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,090
I'm trying to look at it
as being sex positive.

50
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,640
- (FBE) So, that was the music video
for "I Love It" by Kanye West

51
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,440
and Lil Pump.
- Oh, is that Lil Pump?

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,120
- (FBE) As soon as the video released,
there was a viral frenzy online

53
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,260
of people making various memes
and remixes of that music video.

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:35,260
And so, we've got a few
of those to show you now.

55
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,679
- Okay, I think I'll like this
better than the actual music video.

56
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,576
- (snickers) What the [bleep]?

57
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:45,630
- Yes, dude! The remake
in Roblox, bro!

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,530
- They do look like Roblox.
- ♪ You're such a... ♪

59
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:48,680
- (Roblox) Oof. Oof.

60
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,480
- (laughs)
- But who has the time to do this?

61
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,899
- I like people that spend
so many hours on such stupid jokes.

62
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,120
- "Kanye and Lil Pump
on the set for "I Love It."

63
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,760
(laughs)
- This is a joke from my generation.

64
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,060
We all know "Doug."
- I haven't thought about that show

65
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,620
in at least 10 years.
- "I can't believe Tom Brady

66
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,780
was in the new Kanye West
and Lil Pump music video." (laughs)

67
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,500
- (amused) He's wearing a coat
over his football pads.

68
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,670
It makes him look square.
That's a good one.

69
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,350
- The second that music video dropped,
everyone was immediately jumping

70
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,730
on the memes.
They did a good job,

71
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,299
because Kanye even retweeted
some of these memes.

72
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,360
♪ (soft piano music) ♪
- I'm not gonna try to guess

73
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,170
the video game,
'cause I don't wanna embarrass myself.

74
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,790
- 'Cause they're Minecraft blocks.
(chuckles) This is so stupid.

75
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:32,200
- (laughs)

76
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,090
- I was completely thinking
of Minecraft.

77
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,130
- If you come up with a concept
like that, you can't be surprised

78
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,140
there's gonna be some type
of meme that pops up.

79
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,950
- ♪ Like a quick [bleep] ♪
- (laughs)

80
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,549
- ♪ Poopy-di scoop ♪
- Ohhh!

81
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,220
- ♪ Whoop-di-scoop-di-poop ♪
- Whoa, it fits!

82
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,940
- Okay, I actually like that song.

83
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,651
- ♪ Poop-diddy, whoop-scoop ♪
♪ Poop ♪

84
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:57,780
- This is so dumb!
But it's something so simple

85
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,890
but so good.
- ♪ Whoop-diddy-scoop, poop ♪

86
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,130
- Okay. (laughs) I don't know
what to say about that one.

87
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,500
- "Whoop-diddy, scoop-poop."
-- Kanye, 2018.

88
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,760
- There we go.
Kanye retweeted it!

89
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,149
Gotta do the Roblox version.
- Oh, Kanye tweeted it! Okay.

90
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:13,740
I think he-- yeah, he probably
knew what he was doing, definitely.

91
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,260
- It's genius. He--
they're just getting free marketing

92
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,310
out of it, right?
So, he's just taking advantage of it

93
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,310
and talking more
about the music video.

94
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,080
- Memes are nice, though,
because one, they give us all

95
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,010
something to relate to,
because we've all seen

96
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,289
this music video,
so we all understand the jokes.

97
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,550
We all like to be in
on the joke.

98
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,100
- (FBE) So, the same day
this music video was released,

99
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,810
users began posting their own videos
of themselves participating

100
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:38,420
in something like this
using the hashtag, #ILoveItChallenge.

101
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,570
- All of the unnecessary challenges!

102
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,300
- (FBE) So, we have some
of those videos to show you next.

103
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,720
- Interesting. I'm gonna get
some Halloween inspo.

104
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,490
- (laughs) I was thinking,
"How are they gonna look like him?"

105
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:52,180
But that's accurate.
- Oh, this is gonna be

106
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,820
the most popular Halloween costume.

107
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,420
- I did see this on Twitter!
People are now putting boxes

108
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:00,400
on themselves
and doing the same [bleep].

109
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,020
- Kanye West is so strategic
in everything that he does.

110
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,289
He strategically makes things
to be outrageous

111
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,540
and for people to just talk about
for days and weeks.

112
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:12,050
- (chuckles) It's a cardboard box.
- I wanna do that.

113
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,040
I wanna wear a box now.
This is my favorite one so far.

114
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,320
- That's lazy. That's lazy.
You just gonna wear the box?

115
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
You not gonna put, like,
a hoodie on it or nothing?

116
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,350
- I like how [bleep]
these are, too.

117
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,410
(laughs) Like, it's just
a cardboard box.

118
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:29,060
- ♪ She take lines ♪
- These challenges just keep

119
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,570
getting crazier and crazier. (laughs)

120
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:33,159
- Stupid. And this in particular
is definitely not a challenge,

121
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,590
but they're having fun.
- I would be laughing.

122
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,580
If these are my friends,
I would be pissing my pants laughing.

123
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,680
- I can't imagine being the person
filming this video,

124
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,550
'cause I wouldn't be able to.
I'd be dying of laughter. (laughs)

125
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,231
- (chuckles) Look how happy he is
under that jacket.

126
00:05:49,231 --> 00:05:52,090
- The guy in the silver
is definitely committing more to it.

127
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,210
I'll give him that.
- People can get really creative

128
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:57,210
with these things.
- This is exactly, though,

129
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,080
what I would like to see on Snapchat
and Insta stories from people.

130
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,770
- The shoes look almost
exactly similar.

131
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,080
- ♪ She take lines, lines ♪
- Now we're talking.

132
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,130
- There we go.
A little more effort, okay.

133
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,729
- That's accurate, see?
That's a great rendition.

134
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:19,370
- (laughs) I can't.
Why is this a thing?!

135
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:21,790
I don't get it.
- ♪ ...drinking sparkling water

136
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:24,750
before you came out here ♪
- Yeah, this is a "challenge"

137
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,730
that'll die really fast.
You're wearing a box,

138
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,244
playing a song, and then moving.
That takes literally no effort.

139
00:06:31,244 --> 00:06:36,078
- Oh! Squad pull up.
That's the best. Ay, ay.

140
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:37,840
- All right, they're putting
their own little spin on it.

141
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,909
I like it.

142
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,680
- Oh god. Okay, they put in
choreography for this.

143
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,380
I appreciate it a little bit more.

144
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,660
- This is gonna be me and my friends
next time we pull up to a party,

145
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,890
just ready to go. (laughs)

146
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,409
- I'll give them brownie points
for their choreography,

147
00:06:54,410 --> 00:07:00,100
but... just cutting holes in a box
is not enough for me.

148
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,790
- The pictures
and [bleep] were enough.

149
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,900
The roast was enough.
And now, we're out here

150
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:06,109
putting goddamn boxes on
and dancing,

151
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,100
and it's just like, meh,
that's just boring.

152
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,340
It's just kind of predictable.

153
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,890
- (FBE) So now that you've gotten
a taste of the challenge,

154
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,090
we want you to take on the challenge.
- Oh my god.

155
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:16,090
- You have a [bleep] box for me
somewhere in here, huh?

156
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:17,880
All right, bring it!
Come on!

157
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,180
- (FBE) So, in order to do that,
we brought in some special wardrobe

158
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,620
for you to put it on.
- (chuckles)

159
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,290
- (FBE) You ready to do this?
- Cardboard boxes, all right!

160
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,470
- Where is it?
- (FBE) It's right there.

161
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,940
- Nooo! That big box?!

162
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,320
- ♪ ...ho, I love it ♪
- Oh my god. This is actually

163
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,820
harder than I expected.
- ♪ You're such a [bleep] ho ♪

164
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,090
♪ I love it ♪
- (sings along) ♪ I love it ♪

165
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,830
(giggles)
I... hate this.

166
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,979
- This is what he was doing,
right? Kinda.

167
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,820
- ♪ I love it ♪
♪ You're such a... ♪

168
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,010
- I feel like I'm literally as red
as the recording light right now.

169
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,140
- ♪ Your boyfriend is a dork ♪
- This is a really simple challenge.

170
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,370
- ♪ ...McLovin, dork ♪
- (laughs)

171
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:55,115
- I'm gonna go into a club
wearing this. Just be like, "Ladies,

172
00:07:55,115 --> 00:07:57,060
I love it."
And then I'm gonna get kicked out.

173
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,530
- If this is what he does
to make money,

174
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,000
I wanna be Kanye West.
- (raps along) ♪ I'm a sick [bleep] ♪

175
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,240
♪ I like a quick [bleep] ♪
♪ I like my [bleep] sucked ♪

176
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,560
- ♪ I buy you a sick truck ♪
- That's all I know! (laughs)

177
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,030
I'm sorry, Mom!

178
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:12,960
- (FBE) So, both the track
and the music video premiered

179
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,450
at the Pornhub Awards...
- (laughs) Yeah!

180
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,310
- (FBE) ...where Kanye served
as creative director

181
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,530
of the award show.
- That is [bleep] hilarious!

182
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,690
- (FBE) And he designed
every presenter's outfit,

183
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:28,200
and he designed the winning statues
as well as premiering the song

184
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,789
live at the prestigious event.
- Wow! That is so interesting.

185
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,600
- (FBE) But after listening
to this song, why do you think

186
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,480
that they decided to premiere
the track and the music video

187
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:40,020
at the Pornhub Awards of all places?
- I mean, the lyrics do give

188
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,270
a little bit of a sexy vibe, I guess.
- I feel like for sure

189
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:46,010
from the both of them,
this was just a joke.

190
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,140
Yeah, we kind of [bleep] around
and made this song.

191
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,260
So yeah, we'll play it
at the Pornhub Awards.

192
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,340
- It's genius cross promotion
from a mental standpoint,

193
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,380
because it's very sex-positive,
and it's all about that.

194
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:58,220
And then if you're doing it
at the award show for an industry

195
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,530
that's all about sex,
it goes together.

196
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,970
- (FBE) So, critically acclaimed
director Spike Jonze

197
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,460
actually produced the video...
- That, I didn't know.

198
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,530
- (FBE) ...sharing early sketches
of his treatments to reporters.

199
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,810
But the video also features
comedian Adele Givens,

200
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,680
who recites her line
from 2008 Def Comedy Jam stand up

201
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,560
as she towers over the small rappers.
This led some to believe

202
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,339
that even though West and Pump
walk, talk, and dress big,

203
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,800
but when they're facing a woman,
they're just little guys.

204
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,589
- I kind of was getting that
when she's just staring down at them.

205
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,040
- If that's the message we're supposed
to be getting from this, bingo.

206
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,079
But I feel like the attention
is really supposed to still be

207
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,460
on Kanye West and Lil Pump.

208
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,810
- (FBE) After listening to this song
and seeing the music video,

209
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,020
what do you think was the message
that both artists were trying

210
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,390
to get across with this music video?
- Yeah, even if the message was,

211
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:43,470
oh, men try to really impress women
by puffing up their chests,

212
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,312
but really,
they're these smaller guys,

213
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:47,410
the message
is completely missed there.

214
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,930
I think people are really
just looking at it objectively

215
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,930
as they're these
weird Roblox characters,

216
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,120
and they're singing
these really [bleep] lyrics.

217
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,150
- Guys were just talking big,
but in reality,

218
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,569
they're much smaller than women.
Even whenever they're calling her--

219
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,080
or her, women, whatever,
a [bleep] ho,

220
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,850
but she's not really,
and she just wants to achieve orgasm

221
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:14,530
just as much as everyone else does.
- Having a woman in the video

222
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:18,220
stating her side of things
and, you know, what she feels

223
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,330
about sex positivity
kind of balanced it out.

224
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,210
So, I definitely like
that they included her.

225
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,820
And I think that could've been
the message in this.

226
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,360
- (FBE) So, finally,
like you saw earlier,

227
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,690
the music video immediately started
generating both memes

228
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,970
and challenges online.
- Oh yeah, dude. 60 million views

229
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:35,060
in five days, yeah.
It has a lot of attention on it.

230
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,300
- (FBE) This is kind
of the second rap song

231
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,520
in recent memory to do this,
like Drake's "In My Feelings"

232
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,829
and "Hotline Bling"
became a huge meme.

233
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:42,910
Why do you think that all these memes
and challenges are suddenly

234
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,990
coming from hip-hop
and rap music videos specifically?

235
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:52,180
- I feel like it's probably
because it's very dance-y.

236
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,880
The vibe of the songs,
like, "Hotline Bling"

237
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,590
and "In My Feelings,"
it's just a dance-y song.

238
00:10:58,590 --> 00:11:00,900
And I don't really feel like people
are necessarily reading

239
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,250
into the lyrics.
- A lot of hip-hop tends to set the--

240
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,030
They purposely set
their music up like that.

241
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,270
I remember it being similar--
that kind of way when I was a kid.

242
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,840
There was always the popular dance.
I mean, I remember

243
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,960
in elementary school, for a while
it was the Soulja Boy dance.

244
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,430
- Because internet. (laughs)
I mean, they're just asking

245
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,050
to be... meme-ified.
I guarantee you there somebody

246
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,729
in that office
when they were coming up

247
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,840
with the artistic decor,
and they were like,

248
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,320
"Let's do something that people
are gonna make a meme out of,

249
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,164
because it's gonna extra blow up."

250
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:34,120
And whoever that was
probably got a raise.

251
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,960
