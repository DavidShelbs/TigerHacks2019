POLITICIANS HAVE A REPUTATION

00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:24,303
WHILE YOU WERE GOVERNOR, WHAT IS
SOMETHING YOU SAID OR DID THAT

54
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:28,841

I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN SAY THAT.

65
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:07,245
LET ME GIVE YOU THE SHOT.

66
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:16,555

SO WHEN YOU=)■ VETO A BILL FROM 
LEGISLATORS, THEN YOU WRITE A

69
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:23,695
VETO MESSAGE.

70
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:28,768
WELL, THERE WAS ONE LEGISLATOR
THAT I DIDN'T LIKE AT ALL, AND,

71
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:33,339
SO, I VETOED HIS BILL, BUT I
ONLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT HE

72
00:04:33,372 --> 00:04:38,144
GETS THE MESSAGE, SO I WROTE
EACH LINE IN THE VETO MESSAGE,

73
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,614
EACH LINE HAD TO START WITH A
CERTAIN LETTER THAT, WHEN YOU GO

THAT'S ENGLISH CHARM.

111
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,830
IT DOESN'T HELP YOU HERE.

112
00:06:37,863 --> 00:06:44,470
THIS IS A STRAIGHTFORWARD GAME.

113
00:06:44,503 --> 00:06:45,871
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> James: ALL RIGHT, I WILL

114
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:48,707

115
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,109

116
00:06:50,142 --> 00:06:53,945

YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

130
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:28,113
YOU CAN MAKE IT BETTER.

131
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:35,354
AND EIVANKA -- I REMEMBER IVANKA
WAS GOING, I'M TRYING, I'M

132

WEDDING, AND THE NEXT DAY THERE
WAS A DRINKS THING IN THE

136
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:48,067
AFTERNOON AND I FORGOT ALL ABOUT
IT UNTIL I SAW HER ACROSS THIS

137
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,871
SORT OF GARDEN AND IT ALL CAME
BACK.

138
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:55,274

147
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:22,968
ARNOLD, IN THE '90s, YOU

00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,047
EATEN AT PLANET HOLLYWOOD?

151
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,450
( LAUGHTER )
>> WHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT THAT?

152
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:39,517
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

ARE YOU LAUGHING AT ME?

156
00:08:57,202 --> 00:09:05,644
( LAUGHTER )
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT I

157
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:10,082
REMEMBER STILL GOING BACK AFTER

158
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:15,554
EVERYTHING, I STILL WENT BACK,
BUT I DIDN'T GO BACK FOR THE

159
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:19,758
FOOD, BUT I WENT BACK BECAUSE OF
THE OTHER CELEBRITIES BEING

160
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:24,096
THERE AND BECAUSE OF THE GREAT
MERCHANDISE AND DUFF THEY HAD

161
00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:24,663
THERE.

162
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,031
SO, YES, I DID GO BACK.

163
00:09:26,064 --> 00:09:28,300
>> James: THAT WASN'T THE
QUESTION.

164
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,035

186
00:10:57,422 --> 00:11:02,995
>> James: OH, MY GOD -- NOT
ENOUGH MONEY TO (  BLEEP  ) PAY 

187
00:11:03,028 --> 00:11:04,396
TO PLAY THIS.

188
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:06,098
>> THAT WAS VERY COURAGEOUS.

189
00:11:06,131 --> 00:11:07,199
>> James: OH!

190
00:11:07,232 --> 00:11:10,135
I HAVE TO SAY THAT BECAUSE
THAT LOOKS UGLY OVER THERE.

191
00:11:10,168 --> 00:11:11,370
>> James: OKAY.

192
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:12,938

ARNOLD.

200
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,994
YOU AND DONALD TRUMP HAVE A LONG
HISTORY TOGETHER.

201
00:11:36,027 --> 00:11:39,698
RECENTLY, YOU'VE HAD A VERY
PUBLIC FEUD, BUT YOU'VE ALSO

202
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:42,067
KNOWN EACH OTHER SINCE THE
'80s.

203
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:45,738
WHAT IS THE WORST THING YOU'VE
HEARD DONALD TRUMP SAY IN

204
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:50,074
PRIVATE?

205
00:11:50,108 --> 00:12:03,521
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
>> James: WELL, ACTUALLY, IN

206
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:05,891
PRIVATE, HE ALWAYS WAS VERY
NICE.

207
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:08,894
AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE LAST
CONVERSATION I HAD WITH HIM, A

208
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:13,565
PRIVATE CONVERSATION, WAS WHEN
HE CALLED ME AND ASKED ME FOR MY

209
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:21,173
ENDORSEMENT WHEN HE RAN FOR
PRESIDENT, AND I DECLINED.

210
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:29,982
AND, SINCE THEN, EVERYTHING THAT
HE SAYS ABOUT ME OR TO ME IS ON

211
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:30,582
TWITTER.

212
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,518
( LAUGHTER )
WHICH SUCKS.

213
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:33,986
>> James: YEAH.

214
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:35,254
YEAH.

215
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:37,422
SO I THINK HE WAS ALWAYS KIND OF
NICE IN PRIVATE, BUT IN PUBLIC,

216
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:40,759
I THINK THAT HE'S VERY MEAN
SPIRITED WHAT HE SAYS.

217
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:45,631
>> James: I MEAN, THIS IS THE
FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF

00:12:45,664 --> 00:12:48,400
"SPILL YOUR GUTS"Ñi THAT NOBODY'
EATEN HERE.

219
00:12:48,433 --> 00:12:50,269
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU HAVEN'T
EATEN ANYTHING.

220
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,904
>> I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

221
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:54,506
THESE WERE NOT REALLY TOUGH
QUESTIONS.

222
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:57,776
I MEAN, REALLY, I MEAN, I
THOUGHT --

223
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:59,877
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE SOME

224
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:03,515
KIND OF A -- NO, REALLY,
HONESTLY, I THOUGHT THERE WOULD

225
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:08,854
BE SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS THAT I'M
REALLY GOING TO GO, LIKE, GUH --

226
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:12,056

227
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:12,491
>> YEAH.

228
00:13:12,524 --> 00:13:14,960
>> James: OKAY.

229
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:15,994
ARNOLD.

230
00:13:16,028 --> 00:13:19,865
YOU'RE ONE TO HAVE THE
BIGGEST -- YOU'RE ONE OF THE

231
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:24,503
BIGGEST ACTION STARS OF ALL
TIMES AND YOU STARRED IN THE

232
00:13:24,536 --> 00:13:26,537
EXPENDABLES.

RANK THE CO-STARS ON THEIR
ACTING ABILITY FROM BEST TO

234
00:13:30,642 --> 00:13:31,610
WORST.

235
00:13:31,643 --> 00:13:40,052
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
COME ON, YOU CAN DO IT!

236
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:46,658
